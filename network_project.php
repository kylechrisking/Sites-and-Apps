            <h1>Network Security Upgrade</h1>
            <p>A network security upgrade is a comprehensive process designed to enhance the protection of a business's digital infrastructure. It involves a thorough assessment of existing security measures, identification of vulnerabilities, and implementation of new or improved security controls.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Components of a Network Security Upgrade:</h2>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Firewall Upgrade or Replacement:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW): Consider upgrading to an NGFW that offers advanced features like intrusion prevention, application control, and deep packet inspection.</li>
                        <li>Cloud-Based Firewall: Explore cloud-based firewall solutions for scalability and flexibility.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Endpoint Security:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): Deploy EDR solutions to monitor and respond to threats at the endpoint level.</li>
                        <li>Antivirus and Anti-Malware: Ensure up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware software is installed on all endpoints.</li>
                        <li>Patch Management: Implement a robust patch management process to address vulnerabilities promptly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Identity and Access Management (IAM):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Require MFA for critical systems and data access.</li>
                        <li>Strong Password Policies: Enforce strong password policies to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
                        <li>Privileged Access Management (PAM): Control access to privileged accounts and sensitive data.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data at Rest: Encrypt sensitive data stored on servers, storage devices, and databases.</li>
                        <li>Data in Transit: Use encryption protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS) to protect data transmitted over the network.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Logical Isolation: Divide the network into segments to limit the spread of potential breaches.</li>
                        <li>Demilitarized Zone (DMZ): Create a DMZ to isolate public-facing servers from the internal network.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Security Awareness Training:</strong>
